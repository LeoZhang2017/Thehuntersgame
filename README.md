## Overview

The Hunter Games was created as a passion project by Sterling, Matthew, Leo, and Henry. The team's primary goal was to create a game that everyone would enjoy, regardless of skill level or gaming background. The project was never about making money but rather about contributing something meaningful to the gaming community that would bring people together.

What makes The Hunter Games special is how it combines different gaming elements - resource gathering, team-based combat, and survival skills - into a cohesive experience that tests both strategy and reflexes. The team spent countless late nights refining game mechanics, balancing weapons, and designing environments that challenge players while keeping the experience fun and accessible.

The three-stage structure emerged from the desire to create a battle royale that wasn't just about combat, but about adaptation and strategy. Each stage requires different skills and approaches, allowing various player types to shine in different moments. The forum represents the next step in the journey - a place where players can share experiences, strategies, and feedback directly with the creators and with each other.

## Game Information

The Hunter Games consists of 3 stages:

1. **The Warehouse**: Players search for weapons and resources including AK-74, QBB95, Rocket launcher, AKM, L86A2, and AUG A3. Players can also find ammo here.

2. **Reds or Blues?**: A giant arena where red team and blue team fight. Blue enters from the west gate, red from the east gate. Only the top 3 teams advance to the final stage.

3. **The Billionaire Hunter**: Players navigate a forest with a billionaire hunter and Vietnam-styled traps. Surviving this stage means victory.

### Checkpoints:
- Round 1-2 Checkpoint: Sells ammo and basic necessities like food, water, and medical items.
- Round 2-3 Checkpoint: Sells special weapons like grenades, molotovs, and special ammo (incendiary and explosive).

Coins are scattered around the map, not in checkpoints. Players can also acquire weapons from defeated enemies.

## The Creators

The Hunter Games was created by a talented team of four game designers and developers:
